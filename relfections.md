## Presentation 1: Project introduction
Last Monday Matt, Jensen, and I presented to the course our outline of the Belize solar panel project that we are undertaking. While going along with the project proposal and presentation, I began to look back on the experience that I have had previously with databases and realize that it is a lot more than I had ever given myself credit for. I have worked on NoSQL database and SQL database, as well as using a variety of different interfaces to communicate.
