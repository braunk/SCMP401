# Reflections 
## Presentation 1: Project introduction
Last Monday Matt, Jensen, and I presented to the course our outline of the Belize solar panel project that we are undertaking. While going along with the project proposal and presentation, 
I began to look back on the experience that I have had previously with databases and realize that it is a lot more than I had ever given myself credit for. I have worked on NoSQL database 
and SQL database, as well as using a variety of different interfaces to communicate. Not only do I now feel more confident to begin to work on this project, but after meeting with our advisor
Professor Skon a couple times, I feel I have a much more clear picture of how to move forward with my section. First off, I am going to need to boost my knowledge of caching. From there I 
will start to apply those new skills into the database.
