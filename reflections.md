## Presentation 4: Final update
Last Monday I gave my fourth and final presentation. In this presentation I tried to tie up a lot of what I had been working on in the earlier presentations as well as gather final suggestions from the group on what I should add, if anything, before the end of the semester. Over the past few weeks I finished the connection code complete with the classes, started and finished sub-tabling work, and started on editing the vector in my sites class in order to load directly from the subtables instead of being stagnant in the class. 

At this point in the semester I think I've made good progress on the project. I feel that I am hitting the timing of the end of the semester well with the timeline of this project. What is left to do in the project I feel is now add-ons. Throughout the semester I have been getting more confident in my programming abilities, especially now that I have something to show for all of my work. I am excited to see how testing my code speed goes over the next few weeks and finishing fine-tuning what I have.
## Presentation 3: Mid-way update
Last Monday I gave my third presentation, an mid-way project update. In this presentation I tried to focus more on walking through my code in order to explain my classes and functions fully. Over the past few weeks I have completed the connection code, and added a lot more complexity to it. 

The complexity that I added to my connection code was primarily building two classes, called site and sites (bad naming, if I have time it'd be nice to change this). Site stores individual site's information, i.e. name, max watts, number of banks and bank IDs, whereas sites stores a vector of these sites and includes functions that query both inidividual sites in the vector and all of the sites within the vector. 

Most of my issues over the past few weeks have been small errors I've made along the way. Having seen all of these errors after the fact, I think in the future it would be more beneficial for me to do more testing along the way. This is of course a very common practice, but something that I have not been implementing myself (leading to my own demise...). In terms of what skills I think I've improved on so far throughout this project, I think that my SQL ablities, building and defining relevant classes, and on the softer side, cooperation and adaptability when working with others have all improved.

Over the next few weeks I'm hoping to pass off my code to my partners for their use, and my guess is once they start to use the code they will start asking me for more customization and what-not. Hopefully that won't take too long as I am anxious to start working on the sub-tabling process, and I know that once I get that working I will have to go back and revise my class functions and class definitions as well again.
## Presentation 2: Two-week update
Last Monday I presented on the progress that I have made thus far on my portion of the Belize solar panel project. Over the past two weeks of working on this project, I have mostly been doing research on database management techniques, such as caching, as well as research on the specific database that the Belize data is stored on.

Regarding caching, I have come to a relization that this might not be a great addition to the database for some querying aspects because of the time-sensitivity of most of the analysis and visualization of the data. Hopefully, if time permits, I will be able to use this techique still, but I will need to do further research on how to not waste storage space on the server with a large amount of irrelevant querying results. With familiarizing myself with the database, I have learned all of the fields that are relevant to the data we are interested in. This included understanding what all irrelevant data was stored in the 'Answers' database as well (and there is a lot..).

In addition, I have been refreshing myself on mySQL and relearning some C++ database code. The C++ code has been causing me the most issues, as it quite a process to initially connect to the database through C++. I refrenced my code from software development as well as met with Professor Skon several times as a method to answer the questions and issues I was running into.

During my presentation I asked the other students if they thought that learning PHP, a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development, was worth learning to program in to access the database, instead of continuing to program in C++. The most interesting point that I thought was made for PHP was the opportunity that it gave for implementing LAMP stacks, which I had not heard of before and will be researching in the future, but from what little research I have done, sounds like it would be a very useful addition to the website back-end.

## Presentation 1: Project introduction
Last Monday Matt, Jensen, and I presented to the course our outline of the Belize solar panel project that we are undertaking. While going along with the project proposal and presentation, 
I began to look back on the experience that I have had previously with databases and realize that it is a lot more than I had ever given myself credit for. I have worked on NoSQL database 
and SQL database, as well as using a variety of different interfaces to communicate. Not only do I now feel more confident to begin to work on this project, but after meeting with our advisor
Professor Skon a couple times, I feel I have a much more clear picture of how to move forward with my section. First off, I am going to need to boost my knowledge of caching. From there I 
will start to apply those new skills into the database.
