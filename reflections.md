# Reflections 
## Presentation 1: Project introduction
Last Monday Matt, Jensen, and I presented to the course our outline of the Belize solar panel project that we are undertaking. While going along with the project proposal and presentation, 
I began to look back on the experience that I have had previously with databases and realize that it is a lot more than I had ever given myself credit for. I have worked on NoSQL database 
and SQL database, as well as using a variety of different interfaces to communicate. Not only do I now feel more confident to begin to work on this project, but after meeting with our advisor
Professor Skon a couple times, I feel I have a much more clear picture of how to move forward with my section. First off, I am going to need to boost my knowledge of caching. From there I 
will start to apply those new skills into the database.

## Presentation 2: Two-week update
Last Monday I presented on the progress that I have made thus far on my portion of the Belize solar panel project. Over the past two weeks of working on this project, I have mostly been doing research on database management techniques, such as caching, as well as research on the specific database that the Belize data is stored on.

Regarding caching, I have come to a relization that this might not be a great addition to the database for some querying aspects because of the time-sensitivity of most of the analysis and visualization of the data. Hopefully, if time permits, I will be able to use this techique still, but I will need to do further research on how to not waste storage space on the server with a large amount of irrelevant querying results. With familiarizing myself with the database, I have learned all of the fields that are relevant to the data we are interested in. This included understanding what all irrelevant data was stored in the 'Answers' database as well (and there is a lot..).

In addition, I have been refreshing myself on mySQL and relearning some C++ database code. The C++ code has been causing me the most issues, as it quite a process to initially connect to the database through C++. I refrenced my code from software development as well as met with Professor Skon several times as a method to answer the questions and issues I was running into.

During my presentation I asked the other students if they thought that learning PHP, a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development, was worth learning to program in to access the database, instead of continuing to program in C++. The most interesting point that I thought was made for PHP was the opportunity that it gave for implementing LAMP stacks, which I had not heard of before and will be researching in the future, but from what little research I have done, sounds like it would be a very useful addition to the website back-end.
