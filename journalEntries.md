## Week 1/29
This week Matt, Jensen, and I ironed out who will be working on which sections of the project. We have decied the most logical way to work is to have me work on backend (mostly database management), Matt do data analysis, and Jensen do website visualizations. In addition, we met with Skon and worked on a rough draft [list of requirements for the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWqd5NIhoF1ryyyDD_2VsPwRrSpgEWXdVBVjxH6XMO4/edit?usp=sharing), as well as finished the [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHq-PF2LkekZ6_t8fIX1WRgX5D-BSFJQ1DhFqK_1TBY/edit?usp=sharing) and preparing a 45 minute interactive [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kZP0jXcm2uxT3m3x_Rm_kB_gCOMG2oKM6gRh_aI8YIw/edit?usp=sharing) to inform our classmates of what we will be attempting to accomplish this semester.
## Week 2/5
I met with Skon on Wednesday to discuss specifics of the project. I've attached my notes from the meeting [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKVftr6rIlWVmV-PFqNADGkpmC3KiHxBjyMyz9n8Rs8/edit?usp=sharing). Some things that I will need to think about more post-meeting are:
* What sort of queries need to be performed and in what way can I figure out how this queries interact and optimize search results to minimize querying repetition
* How to **only** access the solar panel data, now that I am aware that it sits on the same database table as an abundance of irrelavent data
* Research more about caching (this is a topic that I have never worked with before) and new tables for site specific data
**IN PROGESS**
